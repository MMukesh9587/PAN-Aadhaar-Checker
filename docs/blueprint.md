## Core Features:

- Input Fields: Provide input fields for users to enter their PAN and Aadhaar numbers.
- Validation: Validate the PAN and Aadhaar inputs to ensure they meet the required format and length.
- API Integration: Integrate with a third-party API to check the linking status between PAN and Aadhaar.
- Status Display: Display the linking status to the user (e.g., 'Linked', 'Not Linked', 'Error').
- Error Handling: Handle errors gracefully, providing informative messages to the user if the API is unavailable or if there are issues with the input data.

As a tool, use a genAI chatbot to identify the best resource to resolve errors based on the error status reported.
